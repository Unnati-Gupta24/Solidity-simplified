# Solidity - Simplified 🔷

This repository consolidates knowledge from various Solidity resources, documentation, and real-world development experience. The goal is simple: make Solidity easier to understand without losing any of its depth or accuracy.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository covers everything you need to know about Solidity development:

- **Fundamentals** - Variables, data types, functions, and control structures
- **Smart Contract Basics** - Contract structure, state variables, and modifiers
- **Advanced Concepts** - Inheritance, interfaces, libraries, and abstract contracts
- **Security Best Practices** - Common vulnerabilities and how to avoid them
- **Gas Optimization** - Writing efficient smart contracts
- **Design Patterns** - Proven patterns for production-ready contracts
- **Testing & Deployment** - Development workflow and deployment strategies
